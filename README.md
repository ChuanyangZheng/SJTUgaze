# SJTUgaze is a multiview dataset for gaze estimation collected by Shanghai JiaoTong University
## Abstract
we study the background and development of appearancebased gaze estimation which is currently a kind of mainstream gaze estimation method. There are some shortcomings in the field including scanty gaze dataset and poor ground-truth precision. Aiming at these, we present a new
SJTUgaze gaze dataset to enrich data for gaze estimation.

## Collection Procedure
We show stimuli on a 47-inch LG LCD TV, the TV screen resolution is 1920 √ó 1080, the width and height are 104.1cm, 58.5cm. Then subjects watch these stimuli away from TV in 140 ‚àº 175cm. 
four GoPro cameras are located on the top, down, left and right of the TV screen to capture subjects. The camera‚Äôs resolution is 2704 √ó 1520, and the frame rate is 60Hz. 
At the same time, we use the Tobii X120 eye tracker to track and record the subject‚Äôs gaze direction in real time, and based on this, the truth value labeling was carried out. The sampling rate of the Tobii X120 eye tracker is 60Hz. 
## Characteristics
SJTUgaze gaze dataset contains 127495 face images and corresponding ground-truth gaze directions from 16 subjects under 4 camera views. Compared with existing gaze datasets, SJTUgaze has following Characteristics:
* SJTUgaze uses Tobii X120 eye tracker to record the 3D eye positions of subjects and their corresponding gaze points on the screen. By accurately synchronizing the videos and eye tracker data, face images of corresponding frames are extracted, and the Tobii gaze data is transformed from the user coordinate system of the eye tracker to the camera coordinate system according to the equipment calibration information. So SJTUgaze has more accurate and reliable gaze direction vector labels. 
* SJTUgaze covers wider head pose and gaze direction range. We place four GoPro cameras locating left, right, above and down the television screen to record real-time videos when subjects watch stimuli 140 ‚àº 175ùëêùëö away from TV screen to produce various head poses as much as possible. In this way, SJTUgaze can get plenty of face images with different head poses. 
* Based on four camera views, SJTUgaze is a multiview gaze dataset, which makes up for the current scarce multiview gaze data which can be used for multiview gaze estimation research. 
* In addition, in the data collection process of SJTUgaze, subjects are allowed to move their heads freely, which is more realistic and natural. SJTUgaze also has additional eye movement event category labels, which can play a role in related researches beyond gaze estimation.
